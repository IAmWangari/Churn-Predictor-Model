# Churn-Predictor-Model
Customer churn is a significant business problem that can be effectively addressed using machine learning. 

1. Business Understanding
a. Problem Statement
Customer attrition (churn) is a significant concern for businesses as it directly impacts revenue and growth. Understanding the factors influencing churn and predicting it accurately can help organizations implement proactive retention strategies.

b. Goals and Objectives
Goal: Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn.
Objectives:
Identify key indicators of churn.
Build a model with high accuracy, precision, and recall.
Provide actionable insights to reduce churn rate.
c. Key Metrics and Success Criteria
Key Metrics:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions among all predictions made.
Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class.
F1 Score: The weighted average of Precision and Recall.
ROC-AUC: Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.
Success Criteria: Achieve the following metrics on the test dataset:

Accuracy ≥ 80%
Precision ≥ 0.75
Recall ≥ 0.75
F1 Score ≥ 0.75
ROC-AUC ≥ 0.85
d. Hypothesis (Null and Alternative)
Null Hypothesis: There is no significant relationship between customer attributes (demographics, usage patterns, etc.) and churn.
Alternative Hypothesis: Specific customer attributes significantly influence churn rates.
e. Analytical Questions
How do different customer attributes (e.g., gender, age, service usage) influence churn?
Which services (e.g., internet type, contract terms) are associated with higher churn rates?
Can payment methods affect customer retention?
Is there a correlation between tenure and churn rate?
How effective are promotional offers in reducing churn?
f. Scope and Constraints
Scope: Analysis and modeling will focus on data provided.
Constraints: Limited to the variables and data quality as provided in the dataset.
2. Data Understanding
a. Importation and Data Loading
Load data from CSV files into Python environment.
b. EDA
Data Quality Assessment and Exploring Data:
Check for missing values, outliers, and data types.
Univariate Analysis:
Explore distributions of individual variables.
Bivariate Analysis:
Examine relationships between pairs of variables.
Multivariate Analysis:
Investigate interactions between multiple variables.
c. Answer Analytical Questions with Visualizations
Utilize visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, correlation matrices) to answer analytical questions.
d. Test Hypothesis
Conduct statistical tests or visual inspections to validate or reject hypotheses.
e. Give Insights
Summarize key findings and insights from EDA.
3. Data Preparation
a. Split Data into X, y
Separate features (X) and target variable (y).
b. Split Dataset into Training and Evaluation
Split data into training and test sets.
c. Feature Engineering
    Create a Pipeline to Preprocess Data:
        Separate input features into numeric and categorical pipelines.
        Handle missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.
        Scale or normalize numeric features.
        Encode categorical features.
        Perform transformations for skewed data (e.g., log transformation).
        Balance dataset if necessary.
d. Encode Label/Target
Convert categorical target variable into numerical format.
4. Modeling
a. Fit Data to the Pipeline and Train Model
Train multiple models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree Classifier
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine
5. Evaluation
a. Advanced Model Evaluation and Visualizing Model Performance
Evaluate models using:
ROC curves
Confusion Matrix
Precision & Recall
F1 Score
b. Feature Importance and Selection
Determine feature importance to understand key drivers of churn.
c. Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimize model performance using grid search or random search.
d. Final Model Comparison and Selection
Select the best performing model based on evaluation metrics.
e. Business Impact Assessment and Documentation of the Model
Discuss implications of the model on business decisions and churn reduction strategies.
Document the process, findings, and recommendations in a clear and concise manner.
